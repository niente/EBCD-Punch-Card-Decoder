A PUNCHED CARD OR PUNCH CARD IS A PIECE OF STIFF PAPER THAT CAN BE USED TO
CONTAIN DIGITAL INFORMATION REPRESENTED BY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HOLES
IN PREDEFINED POSITIONS. THE INFORMATION MIGHT BE DATA FOR DATA PROCESSING
APPLICATIONS OR, IN EARLIER EXAMPLES, USED TO DIRECTLY CONTROL AUTOMATED
MACHINERY. THE TERMS IBM CARD, OR HOLLERITH CARD SPECIFICALLY REFER TO
PUNCHED CARDS USED IN SEMIAUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING. PUNCHED CARDS WERE
WIDELY USED THROUGH MUCH OF THE 20TH CENTURY IN WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE
DATA PROCESSING INDUSTRY, WHERE SPECIALIZED AND INCREASINGLY COMPLEX UNIT
RECORD MACHINES, ORGANIZED INTO DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS, USED PUNCHED
CARDS FOR DATA INPUT, OUTPUT, AND STORAGE. MANY EARLY DIGITAL COMPUTERS
USED PUNCHED CARDS, OFTEN PREPARED USING KEYPUNCH MACHINES, AS THE
PRIMARY MEDIUM FOR INPUT OF BOTH COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND DATA. WHILE
PUNCHED CARDS ARE NOW OBSOLETE AS A RECORDING MEDIUM, AS OF 2012,
SOME VOTING MACHINES STILL USE PUNCHED CARDS TO RECORD VOTES.
